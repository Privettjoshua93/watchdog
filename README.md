# watchdog
Monitors your repo, continuously updating a single text file with the file paths and file content of your choosing. This is so you can quickly generate a txt file that can be sent to an LLM for coding assistance on your project.

Clone the repo and run the executable file in the dist folder to launch the script.

# Reqs
in case you want to manually run the main.py file and install the pre-reqs yourself:
pip install watchdog
